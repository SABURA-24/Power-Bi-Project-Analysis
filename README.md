## 📌 Recommendations by Data Analyst

1. **Focus Promotional Campaigns on Top Cities**  
   Cities like **New York, LA, and Philadelphia** have the highest order volumes. Increasing targeted marketing in these areas could lead to substantial ROI.

2. **Reevaluate Underperforming Products**  
   The bottom 5 products contribute minimally to revenue. Consider removing them or bundling them with bestsellers to improve movement.

3. **Strengthen Product Offerings in Growing Categories**  
   **Furniture** shows positive YoY growth—more SKUs or higher-value variants in this segment could enhance revenue further.

4. **Address Declining Office Supplies Sales**  
   Although this is the top revenue-generating category, it's declining YoY. Investigate pricing, customer preferences, or competitor activity.

5. **Leverage High-Margin Regions**  
   With the **West and East regions** contributing over 60% of sales, consider launching loyalty or referral programs specifically in these regions.

6. **Optimize Shipping Strategy**  
   Since **Standard Class** dominates shipping (60.51%), analyze if promotions for quicker delivery could increase conversions without impacting margin.

7. **Analyze Customer Segments Further**  
   Break down performance by **Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office** segments to tailor offers and product assortments accordingly.
